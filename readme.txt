TODO

Choose one of the following projects we brainstormed in class:

personal portfolio
SPD website
SPD intranet site
After choosing your assignments, name them accordingly, and:

Create two HTML pages
for example Homepage and a Project page, be attentive to the semantics, validate your results

Add the necessary meta tags
to add value, come up looking professional in search results, and when sharing the links on social channels

Style the pages
use an external Stylesheet, try to choose meaningful class names, try and use the most suitable CSS modules for the layout, donâ€™t be afraid to try out things like CSS variables.

Make sure that the pages are responsive and fluid, so one can enjoy them on any device.

Animate the pages
make use of CSS transitions and animations to add life to your pages.

Use GSAP to create more complex animation sequences. At the end add the GSAP ScrollTrigger to activate the animations on enter or on leave.

Making use of GitHub
commit often, write descriptive commit messages. Connect the repository with Netlify and provide the link to the pages. Document all of your work in a README.md file saved in the root of your repository, next to the index.html file.
